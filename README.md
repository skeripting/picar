# picar
This code interfaces with the Raspberry Pi 4 and controls a
Remote Controlled Car for the CPT 210 class as taught by
Professor Bruce Link at MCC. Starting up the program creates a
web server for the PiCar, where you can control it.

The mode is changed through the buttons under the "Car Mode" header.
The webserver also features a slider for the car speed, which controls
the speed, as well as the direction. A Jingle Bells button is also
added at the bottom, where the car plays jingle bells.
